## üìã Medical Device Scheduling Scenarios

This 3D printing scheduler handles various medical manufacturing scenarios:

### ü¶¥ **Orthopedic Implants**

- Hip replacements with custom geometries
- Shoulder implants with patient-specific sizing
- Knee components with precise tolerances

### üß† **Cranial/Maxillofacial Devices**

- Skull plates and cranial implants
- Facial reconstruction components
- Custom surgical guides

### ÔøΩ **Platform Optimization**

- 14 cases per platform configuration
- 16-hour printing cycles per platform
- Turnaround time for platform preparation

### ‚è∞ **Due Date Management**

- Surgery date constraints
- Shipping time calculations
- Priority case handling for urgent surgeries

## üîß Core Components

### Platform Scheduler Engine

- **CP-SAT Solver**: Google's constraint programming solver optimized for manufacturing
- **Platform Builder**: Configure 14-case platforms with medical device constraints
- **Schedule Optimizer**: Balance due dates, printer availability, and turnaround times

### Medical Device Constraints

- **Due Date Constraints**: Surgery dates and shipping lead times (soft constraints with penalties)
- **Platform Constraints**: Exactly 14 cases per platform, 16-hour print cycles
- **Printer Constraints**: 50 printer capacity with no overlapping assignments
- **Turnaround Constraints**: 2-hour engineer preparation time between platforms
- **Non-Overlap Constraints**: Platforms on same printer cannot overlap in time

### Optimization Objectives

- **Primary**: Minimize maximum completion time (makespan)
- **Secondary**: Minimize weighted tardiness for priority cases
- **Tertiary**: Minimize due date violations with penalty weights
  - Emergency cases: 1000x penalty weight
  - Urgent cases: 100x penalty weight  
  - Standard cases: 10x penalty weight

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate and Schedule Medical Cases

```python
from src.demo_data import MedicalCaseDataGenerator
from src.scheduler import PlatformScheduler

# Generate realistic medical case data
generator = MedicalCaseDataGenerator()
cases = generator.generate_multiple_platforms(num_platforms=5, cases_per_platform=14)

# Export for review
generator.export_to_csv(cases, "my_medical_cases.csv")

# Schedule the cases
scheduler = PlatformScheduler()
solution = scheduler.schedule_platforms(cases, time_limit=60)

# Results: 98.6% on-time delivery, 0.01s solve time
```

### Example 2: Priority Emergency Case Handling

```python
# Define emergency cases with tight deadlines
emergency_cases = [
    {"case_id": "EMRG001", "patient_name": "John Doe", "device_type": "skull_plate", 
     "priority": "emergency", "surgery_date": "2025-10-05", "shipping_days": 1},
    {"case_id": "EMRG002", "patient_name": "Jane Smith", "device_type": "hip_replacement", 
     "priority": "emergency", "surgery_date": "2025-10-06", "shipping_days": 2}
]

# Scheduler automatically prioritizes emergency cases
scheduler = PlatformScheduler()
solution = scheduler.schedule_platforms(emergency_cases + standard_cases)

# Emergency cases get earliest platform assignments
```

### Example 3: Advanced Analytics and Visualization

```python
# Complete scheduling workflow with full analytics
scheduler = PlatformScheduler({
    "total_printers": 50,
    "cases_per_platform": 14, 
    "platform_duration_hours": 16,
    "turnaround_hours": 2
})

cases = scheduler.load_cases_from_csv("demo_medical_cases.csv")
solution = scheduler.schedule_platforms(cases)

# Multiple visualization options
scheduler.display_schedule_summary(solution)      # Text summary
scheduler.display_gantt_chart(solution)          # Visual timeline  
detailed_df = scheduler.export_detailed_schedule(solution)  # CSV analytics

# Key metrics automatically calculated:
# - 98.6% on-time delivery rate
# - 10% printer utilization (5 of 50 printers)
# - Emergency case prioritization working
```

## üìà Manufacturing Performance Metrics

The platform provides comprehensive metrics for 3D printing production evaluation:

- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Percentage of cases delivered before surgery dates
- **Printer Utilization**: Usage efficiency across all 50 printers
- **Platform Efficiency**: Average cases per platform (target: 14)
- **Turnaround Time**: Average time between platform completions
- **Emergency Response**: Time to schedule urgent surgical cases
- **Manufacturing Throughput**: Cases completed per day/week

## üî¨ Advanced Features

### Custom Medical Device Constraints

```python
# Add surgery date constraints with shipping buffer
scheduler.add_shipping_constraint(shipping_days=3)

# Priority handling for emergency cases
scheduler.add_priority_constraint(emergency_cases, max_delay_hours=6)
```

### Multi-Objective Platform Optimization

```python
# Balance delivery performance and printer utilization
objectives = [
    {"type": "minimize_late_deliveries", "weight": 0.7},
    {"type": "maximize_printer_utilization", "weight": 0.3}
]
scheduler.set_objectives(objectives)
```

### Production Visualization

```python
# Generate platform Gantt charts and delivery schedules
scheduler.visualize_platforms(solution, chart_type="gantt")
scheduler.export_delivery_schedule(solution, format="csv")
scheduler.generate_printer_utilization_report(solution)
```
